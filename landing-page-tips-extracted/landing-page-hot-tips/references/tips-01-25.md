# Landing Page Hot Tips #01-25

## #01 - Utilize Customer Testimonials
Highlight features and answer doubts through testimonials.

**Bad testimonial:** "Great product, highly recommend!" - Generic, no value

**Good testimonial:** "The build quality exceeded expectations and arrived perfectly packaged despite international shipping." - Highlights feature (build quality) + answers doubt (shipping damage)

**Action:** Review all testimonials, keep only those adding specific value.

**Resources:**

## #02 - Showcase Testimonials from Similar Demographics
Match testimonial sources to your target audience.

Selling enterprise software? Feature testimonials from enterprise customers with their title and company.

**Example:** "Dave Lewis, VP Customer Relations at Starbucks" carries more weight for enterprise buyers than "Dave L."

Start with their pain, then explain your solution simply.

- Your TOP 4 reviews
- The 3 STRONGEST case studies

**Goal:** Persuade with as little as possible.

---

## #09 - Set a Single Objective
One landing page = one goal.

**Wrong:** Sell eBook + promote job board + collect newsletter signups

**Right:** Sell eBook

The beauty of a landing page is the single canvas to persuade one action.

---

## #10 - Create a Text Color Hierarchy
Pure black (#000) on pure white (#FFF) is harsh and screams "amateur."

**Action:**
1. Use off-white background (#FAFAFA or similar)
2. Create grey hierarchy for text (headings darker, body lighter)
3. Check contrast meets accessibility standards

**Resources:**
- Contrast for Mac - ensure text meets accessibility standards
- Accessible Color Generator - find nearest passing color

---

## #11 - Remove Your Main Nav
If your landing page sits within a bigger website, hide the navigation.

Sending visitors to other pages is NOT your objective.

**Exception:** Sticky nav with page sections + CTA only (see #25)

---

## #12 - Use Footer for Pre-Sale Support
Visitor hasn't converted by the end of scroll = they still have doubts.

**Footer should include:**
- FAQs addressing pre-sale concerns
- Support email/contact
- Final CTA

This area could be the difference between visitor and customer.

---

## #13 - Highlight USP Among Feature List
12 features in a grid overwhelms first-time visitors.

**Action:**
1. Lead with your 2-3 Unique Selling Propositions
2. Emphasize benefits of choosing you over competition
3. Then show supporting features

---

## #14 - Offer More Pricing Tiers
Tier UP with more features, not DOWN by stripping core offering.

- Twitter10
- Insta10
- LinkedIn10
- NYTimes10

Dedicated coupons uncover which channels are effective while feeling exclusive.

---

## #16 - Embed Your Lead Forms
Every page load drops conversion rate.

**Wrong:** [Click here to Sign Up] → loads new page

**Right:** (Enter your email) [Sign Up] embedded on page

Capture leads immediately.

---

## #17 - If You Market to Everyone, It Resonates with No One
Identify your audience. Research their language. Craft copy they appreciate.

**Generic:** "Join the biggest Lord of the Rings fan club online"

**Targeted:** "An online community where second breakfast is a dietary staple and Old Toby's smoke drifts from humble abodes."

**CTA:** "Enter Hobbiton for $9/month" vs "Join Club for $9/month"

What copy makes visitors think "These are my people"?

---

## #18 - Sit With Someone and Watch Them Convert
Two ways to experience horror:
1. Rent a gory R-rated film
2. Watch someone interact with your landing page

**Action:** Find someone from your target market. Watch them try to convert. Take notes on friction points.

---

## #19 - Set a Max-Width for Typography (CPL)
100% width paragraphs are difficult to read on large screens.

**Target:** 55-100 characters per line (CPL)

**Resources:**

- GRT Calculator - Golden Ratio Typography calculator

---

## #20 - Highlight Testimonial from Opinion Leader
Feature someone well-known to your target audience.

**Example scenario:** Selling icon pack. Visitor is unsure about $49 price. Scrolls to testimonial from Klaudia, designer at Spotify they follow on Twitter.

Thought process: "She has great taste. These icons must be best-in-class."

This is the game-changing Joker card in your deck.

---

## #21 - Avoid Animation Overkill
Gratuitous scroll transitions no longer impress.

Subtle animations are timeless and show intent.

**Rule:** Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

---

## #22 - Consider a Color Scheme
A carefully crafted color scheme stands out and shows effort.

Visitors assume that effort carries over to your product/service.

---

## #23 - Avoid the Word "Cheap"
Positioning as "cheaper" sells your offering short and raises quality concerns.

**Use instead:**
- More affordable
- Economical
- Cost-effective
- Better value

---

## #24 - Create Haste
Offer discount or gift within diminishing timeframe.

**Elements:**
- Countdown timer positioned near CTA
- Clear savings amount ("Save 60%")
- Specific deadline

**Resource:** Countdown timer scripts

---

For long landing pages, sticky header provides:

Keep it minimal: section links + primary CTA only.
