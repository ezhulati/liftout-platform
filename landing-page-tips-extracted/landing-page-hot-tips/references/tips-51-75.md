# Landing Page Hot Tips #51-75

## #51 - Increase Demand by Limiting Supply
Scarcity drives action.

**Tactics:**
- "Only 12 spots remaining"
- "Limited edition - 100 units"
- "Enrollment closes Friday"

Must be genuine - false scarcity destroys trust.

---

## #52 - Add Social Proof
Numbers build confidence:
- "Join 10,000+ customers"
- "Trusted by 500 companies"
- "4.9 stars from 2,000 reviews"

**Placement:** Near CTA buttons and in hero section.

---

## #53 - Focus on Solving Copy First
Design enhances good copy. It can't save bad copy.

**Process:**
1. Write all copy first
2. Test copy for clarity
3. Then design around it

Never let design drive the message.

---

## #54 - Consider Dark Mode
Dark mode is:
- Easier on eyes in low light
- Increasingly expected
- A differentiator

**Implementation:** CSS media query for prefers-color-scheme, or manual toggle.

---

## #55 - Align Your Marketing
Landing page should match:
- Ad creative that drove traffic
- Email that linked to it
- Social post that promoted it

Consistency reduces confusion and builds trust.

---

## #56 - Increase the Contrast of Your Button Text
Low-contrast button text kills conversions.

**Test:** Squint at your CTA. Can you still read it?

**Action:** White text on dark buttons, dark text on light buttons. Check WCAG contrast ratios.

---

## #57 - Only A/B Test High-Traffic Pages
A/B testing requires statistical significance.

**Reality check:**
- 100 visitors/month = meaningless results
- 10,000 visitors/month = valuable insights

Low traffic? Make decisive changes based on best practices instead.

---

## #58 - Minimize the Options
Paradox of choice: more options = fewer decisions.

**Apply to:**
- Pricing tiers (3-4 max)
- Form fields (only essential)
- Navigation items
- CTA variations per section

When in doubt, remove.

---

## #59 - Try Font Smoothing
CSS font smoothing can improve text rendering:

```css
body {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
```

**Note:** Test across browsers - results vary.

---

## #60 - Liven with Illustrations
Custom illustrations:
- Add personality
- Differentiate from stock photo competitors
- Can explain complex concepts

**Resources:** Fiverr, Dribbble, dedicated illustration services

---

## #61 - Trim the Fat
Review every element and ask: "Does this help convert?"

If no, remove it.

Be ruthless. Your visitor's attention is limited.

---

## #62 - Include Email in Error Messages
When something breaks, visitors need help.

**Bad:** "An error occurred"

**Good:** "Something went wrong. Please try again or contact support@company.com"

Don't strand confused visitors.

---

## #63 - Add a Radial Burst Behind Product Imagery
Subtle radial gradient behind product images:
- Draws eye to product
- Adds depth
- Separates product from background

Simple CSS or design technique with big impact.

---

## #64 - Delay the Chatbot
Immediate chatbot popup = annoying interruption.

**Better approach:**
- Delay 30-60 seconds
- Trigger on exit intent
- Show only on pricing/FAQ pages
- Or just use static "Contact us" link

---

## #65 - Offer a Demo Down-Sell
Visitor won't buy? Offer lower-commitment alternative.

**Example:**
- Won't buy course? Offer free chapter
- Won't subscribe? Offer one-time purchase
- Won't sign up? Offer newsletter

Capture interest for later conversion.

---

## #66 - Open Non-Essential Links in New Tab

If content exists below the fold, indicate it.

**Examples:**
- Interactive widget

Reduce steps between curiosity and conversion.

---

## #71 - Don't Shortcut Hosting
Cheap hosting = slow pages = lost conversions.

**Invest in:**
- Reliable uptime
- Fast servers
- CDN for global visitors

Your landing page is your storefront. Don't cheap out.

First impression of your customer relationship.
