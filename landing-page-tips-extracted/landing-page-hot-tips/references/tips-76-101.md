# Landing Page Hot Tips #76-101

## #76 - Soft Launch with a Discount
Early adopters take risk on unproven products.

**Reward them:**
- Early bird pricing
- Founding member discount
- Launch week special

Creates urgency AND shows appreciation.

---

## #77 - Implement Smooth Scroll
Smooth scrolling when clicking anchor links:
- Feels polished
- Maintains context
- Better than jarring jumps

```css
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

---

## #78 - Define a Visual Hierarchy
Not everything is equally important. Show it.

**Hierarchy tools:**
- Size (bigger = more important)
- Color (bright/dark = attention)
- Position (top/center = primary)
- Whitespace (isolation = emphasis)

Guide the eye deliberately.

---

## #79 - Remove Inactive Social Media Accounts
Dead social links hurt trust.

- Last tweet from 2019? Remove Twitter link
- Empty Instagram? Remove it
- No YouTube videos? Remove it

Only link what you actively maintain.

---

## #80 - Wrap It in a Device
Product screenshots look more professional in device mockups.

**Use cases:**
- App in phone frame
- Dashboard in laptop
- Website in browser window

**Resources:** Mockup generators, Figma templates, Sketch libraries

---

## #81 - Define Container Width
Set maximum width for your content container.

**Common widths:**
- 1200px for wide layouts
- 960px for focused reading
- 720px for text-heavy content

Prevents content from stretching uncomfortably on large screens.

---

## #82 - Prove You Are Established
Years in business + stats = powerful trust combo.

**Show:**
- "Founded in 2015"
- "10,000+ customers served"
- "$5M in transactions processed"
- "Operating in 40 countries"

Reduces perceived risk of commitment.

---

## #83 - Strategically Position Testimonials
Don't dump all testimonials in one section.

**Strategic placement:**
- After explaining a feature (proof it works)
- Before pricing (justify the cost)
- Near CTA (final push)
- Addressing specific objection (overcome doubt)

Match testimonial content to its location's purpose.

---

## #84 - Focus on People, Not Search Engines
SEO matters, but don't sacrifice user experience for it.

**Priority:**
1. Write for humans first
2. Optimize for search second

Google increasingly rewards user satisfaction anyway.

---

## #85 - Show Them How It Works
First question for SaaS visitors: "How much?"
Second question: "How does it work?"

**Answer with:**
- Step-by-step walkthrough
- Numbered process

- Animated demo

Don't make them guess.

---

## #86 - Include an Explainer Video
Video can:

**Ideal length:** 60-90 seconds

## #87 - Focus on Form UX
Forms are where conversions happen or die.

**Best practices:**

- Clear labels
- Inline validation
- Helpful error messages

If running costs are low and support demands minimal:

**Offer lifetime access** for one-time payment.

- Immediate cash flow

---

## #89 - Focus on Benefits, Not Features
Natural instinct: list technical features.

**Reality:** Visitors don't care about features. They care about outcomes.

**Feature:** "256-bit encryption"
**Benefit:** "Your data stays private and secure"

**Feature:** "AI-powered algorithm"
**Benefit:** "Get results in seconds, not hours"

---

## #90 - Alternate Section Background Colors
Slightly different background for alternating sections:
- Improves visual separation

Subtle shade differences work best.

---

## #91 - Bring It to Life
Static pages feel dead.

**Add life with:**
- Subtle hover animations
- Loading transitions
- Micro-interactions
- Scroll-triggered reveals
- Video backgrounds (used sparingly)

Movement draws attention and adds polish.

---

## #92 - Keep It Positive
Position your offering as confident solution, not snarky competitor.

**Negative:** "Unlike those other tools that waste your time..."

**Positive:** "Save hours every week with streamlined workflows"

Positivity attracts. Negativity repels.

---

## #93 - Emphasize the Value
"$79 Design Course worth $249" - weak appeal

**Better framing:**
- What they'll be able to do after
- Time/money they'll save
- Problems they'll solve
- ROI they'll achieve

Value > price comparison.

---

## #94 - Consider Parity Pricing
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) = discounted price for weaker currencies.

**Why:**

**Implementation:** Country-based discount codes or automatic detection.

---

## #95 - Reuse Winning Templates
Tempting to start fresh every launch.

**Better approach:**
- Identify your best-performing landing page

- Update content only

Don't reinvent what's already working.

---

## #96 - Don't Get Too Fancy

All have their place. But if you're new to landing pages and not making sales:

**Focus on fundamentals first:**

- Simple design
- Fast loading

Fancy can wait.

Your product looks great. But WHY is this part of your life's journey?

**Share:**

- Mission/purpose
- What drove you to create this

People connect with purpose, not just products.

---
