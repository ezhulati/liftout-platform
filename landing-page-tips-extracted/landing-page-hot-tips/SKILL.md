# Landing Page Hot Tips

100 digestible lessons for creating high-converting landing pages. Based on Rob Hope's expertise from One Page Love.

## Core Philosophy

Before applying any tip, answer these three questions:
1. Who is your target demographic?
2. What is their problem?
3. How does your offering solve it?

Context is everything. Apply tips that resonate with YOUR specific situation.
