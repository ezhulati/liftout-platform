By hiring away whole teams from a competitor, companies can quickly gain capacity without all the headaches of a merger or acquisition. It’s a high-risk, high-reward move.

Companies looking to expand quickly into a new geographic or functional area often choose to merge with or acquire other companies. But the risks of such moves are well known, and the success rates are dismal. Strategic individual hires are an option, but slower, and star performers often depend on team contexts to succeed.

A lift out—hiring a high-functioning group that already works well together—solves this. It preserves team relationships and allows “plug-and-play” deployment. This approach has a long history, beginning with the 1946 Ford Motor Company lift out of the U.S. Air Force “Whiz Kids.” Today, lift outs appear frequently across law, advertising, investment banking, consulting, general management, and medicine.

Advantages include rapid impact, trust within the incoming group, valuable external relationships, and the ability to hurt a competitor. But the risks are real: poor planning, cultural mismatch, loss of money, public failures, and even losing your own talent.

Research shows every successful lift out follows **four stages**:

---

# **1. Courtship (Prior to Lift Out)**

The acquiring company and the team leader meet to:

- Confirm market opportunity  
- Align on goals and strategy  
- Evaluate whether the team’s relationships and capabilities are transferable  
- Quietly gauge interest among team members  
- Prepare against counteroffers

If skipped, both sides risk failure.

**Examples:**

### **BZW’s failed Drexel lift out**
BZW rushed into the U.S. equities market without a realistic understanding of its competitive disadvantage. The entire venture collapsed within a year, harming the incoming team.

### **Orrick’s successful Italian lift out**
Orrick correctly identified opportunity in Italy’s regulatory reform. It hired 23 lawyers, including seven partners, from Ernst & Young’s Milan affiliate. The office doubled in size and expanded to Rome.

### **Assess external relationships carefully**
Client loyalty is unpredictable. Interpublic’s attempt to lure General Mills by lifting out 17 Saatchi executives failed; General Mills stayed with Saatchi.

### **Team structure**
Hiring firms should evaluate **all** team members—including backstage contributors—before deciding who should move.

# **2. Leadership Integration (Post–Lift Out)**

The first priority is integrating the **team leader** with the hiring firm’s senior leadership.

Why it matters:

- Team loyalty often runs to the leader more than the organization  
- Access to senior leadership determines resource flow  
- Cultural compatibility is essential

**Example: Duane Morris law firm**  
Duane Morris succeeds repeatedly with lift outs because it has:

- A clear culture  
- Explicit values  
- Consistent practices across offices  
- Transparent compensation and decision-making norms

This clarity helps incoming leaders integrate quickly.

Conversely, integration should **not** be used to force cultural change onto either side. “Opposites attract” rarely works in corporate environments.

# **3. Operational Integration**

This stage determines whether the team can actually do its job.

Success depends on:

- Resources ready on day one (desks, tools, systems, support)  
- Minimal disruption to daily work  
- Continuity of clients and operating practices  
- Autonomy plus clear goals  
- Support from senior leadership

**Example: Baker & McKenzie’s lift out from Mancera Ernst & Young**  
Team leader Moises Curiel ensured everything was in place on day one—offices, laptops, cars, and infrastructure—so the team could start immediately.

**Example: Linklaters’ Prague lift out**  
Linklaters hired ~50 lawyers from a local Prague office. Because they continued serving the same clients, the transition was seamless—“Change the nameplate and business cards, and you’re in business the next day.”

**Transnational lift outs**  
Cross-border moves have higher risk unless the team is hired for its **regional expertise** and continues operating largely the same way.

---

# **4. Full Cultural Integration**

Even top teams must **re-earn credibility**.

Key principles:

- Operational success builds trust  
- Avoid “in-group vs. out-group” rifts  
- Manage expectations of existing employees  
- Encourage cross-department relationships  
- Strong leaders must not isolate their teams

**Example: Robbers Cave experiment**  
Groups form rivalries naturally. Shared operational challenges—not forced togetherness—create genuine mutual respect.

**Example: Lehman Brothers**  
Tortoriello’s team successfully integrated by:

- Setting expectations with existing analysts  
- Delivering operational wins  
- Building relationships outside their group  
- Demonstrating consistent value  

**Failure Example: Banque Indosuez**  
Indosuez rushed its Drexel lift out. Internal staff resented the outsiders due to sudden change and unclear direction. The integration collapsed.

---

# **High Stakes: Best vs. Worst Cases**

## **The Ideal: Tortoriello’s Move to Lehman Brothers**

Success factors:

- Pre-existing trust between leaders  
- Careful preparation  
- Strong leadership alignment  
- Autonomy with support  
- Operational continuity even after 9/11  
- Conscious, thoughtful cultural integration

## **The Disaster: The Saatchi 17**

One of the most catastrophic lift outs ever:

- Saatchi loses 17 execs and upsets General Mills  
- General Mills stays with Saatchi anyway  
- Mike Burns becomes entangled in a lawsuit  
- Interpublic ends up with a rebellious team and no major account  
- The team becomes known more for drama than client work  

Every party suffered.

---

# **Conclusion**

A lift out is a **high-risk, high-reward** play.  
If managed well, it provides:

- Speed  
- Cohesion  
- Immediate operational impact  
- Strategic talent advantage  

But if mishandled, it leads to:

- Cultural rejection  
- Lost investment  
- Damaged reputation  
- Broken client relationships  
- Unemployment for the team  

Success depends on meticulous execution across all four stages.
