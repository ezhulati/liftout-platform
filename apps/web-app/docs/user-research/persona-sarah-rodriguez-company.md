## 2. The Problem (Ordinary World)

### Current Situation
Sarah runs talent acquisition for NextGen Financial, a fast-growing fintech. The company needs to build an analytics division from scratch - the CEO wants a 6-person data science team operational within 90 days. Board is watching.

Sarah has budget approval. She has recruiter bandwidth. What she doesn't have is time to hire 6 individuals, hope they gel, and wait 12 months for them to become productive.

### What's Not Working
- **Individual hiring is slow**: Average time-to-fill for senior data scientist: 87 days. She needs 6.
- **Team formation is slower**: Tuckman says forming → storming → norming → performing takes 6-12 months
- **Stars don't shine alone**: Last year's "rockstar" ML hire from Google? Decent, but keeps saying "at Google we did it this way"
- **Attrition compounds risk**: If 1 of 6 leaves in year 1, team chemistry resets to zero
- **CEO pressure**: "I hired you to solve this. Don't tell me about Tuckman's model."

### The Numbers That Haunt Sarah
| Stat | Source | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| 75% of employers hired wrong person | SHRM | "I've been part of that 75%" |
| $240K average cost of bad hire | SHRM | "That's 3 bad hires = $720K burned" |
| 46% performance decline when stars move alone | Groysberg | "My star hires aren't performing like their resumes promised" |
| 12 months to peak productivity | Gallup | "I don't have 12 months. I have 90 days." |

### Failed Alternatives
1. **Agency recruiters**: Expensive ($30K per hire), still 60-90 day timelines, no team chemistry guarantee
2. **Internal mobility**: Asked other divisions for transfers. Got 2 analysts, neither with ML experience.
3. **Acquihire negotiation**: Explored buying a 4-person startup. Took 4 months, fell apart on valuation.
4. **Contractor team**: Hired 3 contractors through Toptal. Good work, but they're leaving in 6 months.

### Emotional State
- **Pressured**: "The board presentation is in 90 days. I need bodies."
- **Skeptical**: "Every recruiter promises they can fill these roles. None deliver."
- **Frustrated**: "I keep hiring individuals who looked great on paper and can't work together."
- **Anxious**: "If I fail at this, it's my job on the line."

### The Core Tension
> "I can find talented individuals. But I can't manufacture chemistry. You can't interview for trust."

---

## 3. Discovery (Call to Adventure)

### The Trigger
Sarah attends a YPO dinner. Another talent exec mentions hiring a "lift out" from a competitor - an entire 4-person investment banking team. Sarah's never heard the term.

"Wait, you hired all four? As a package deal?"

"Yeah. They'd been together 5 years. Hit the ground running. Best hire I ever made."

### How Sarah Found Liftout
1. **That night**: Googles "lift out hiring" and "team-based hiring"
2. **Day 2**: Reads HBR article "Lift Outs: How to Acquire a High-Functioning Team"
3. **Day 3**: Deep dive into Groysberg's "Chasing Stars" research
4. **Day 4**: Finds Liftout, explores "For Companies" page
5. **Day 5**: Creates account to browse available teams

### Initial Skepticism
- "This is probably just consultants trying to justify their fees"
- "Teams won't actually move together - someone always backs out"
- "The best teams aren't on the market"
- "Legal will never approve this"

### The Aha Moment
Reading the problem statement: **"You're not hiring their talent—you're hiring them minus everything that made them great."**

Then the statistics hit:
- Star performers decline 46% when moving alone
- New hires take 12 months to reach peak productivity
- Psychological safety (built over years) accounts for 43% of team performance

Sarah realizes: She's been trying to build chemistry through hiring. What if she could just *buy* chemistry?

---

## 4. Why Sarah Signed Up (Crossing the Threshold)

### Value Proposition That Resonated
1. **Day-one productivity**: "Skip the 12-month ramp-up" - exactly what CEO demanded
2. **Proven chemistry**: "Relationships that took years to build" - can't be replicated
3. **Reduced risk**: "Verified track records" - not just interview performance
4. **Speed**: "Teams already formed" - no 6x individual searches

### Trust Signals That Mattered
- Harvard research citations (academic credibility)
- Real examples: Microsoft/Inflection, law firm group laterals
- SHRM and Gallup data (industry authority)
- Anonymous browsing before commitment
- NDA-protected conversations

### Fears Overcome
| Fear | How Liftout Addressed It |
|------|-------------------------|
| "Teams will be overpriced" | Market data on team compensation vs. 6x individual hires |
| "Legal will block it" | Documentation of industry precedent (law firms, banking) |
| "Best teams aren't looking" | Confidential platform means good teams can explore safely |
| "Someone will back out" | Verified team commitments, cohesion scoring |

### What Sarah Hoped to Gain
- **For the company**: Analytics division operational in 90 days
- **For her career**: Delivered on CEO mandate, innovative approach
- **For her team**: A new tool in the talent acquisition toolkit
- **For herself**: Proof that there's a better way than individual hiring

---

## 5. The Journey (Tests, Allies, Enemies)

### Onboarding Experience
**Day 1**: Creates account, selects "Company" user type, enters company info
**Day 2**: Completes company profile, adds culture/values
**Day 3**: Posts first opportunity: "Lead FinTech Analytics Division"
**Week 1**: Reviews 8 team profiles, sends 3 inquiries

### First Actions
1. Browsed available teams without posting (research phase)
2. Posted opportunity with detailed requirements
3. Set up saved searches for data science teams in fintech
4. Used AI matching to identify top candidates
5. Sent first expression of interest to TechFlow team

### Allies
- **CFO**: Ran numbers on team hire vs. 6 individual hires. Team was cheaper per productive-hour.
- **CEO**: "I don't care how you do it. Just get it done."
- **General Counsel**: Surprisingly supportive after reviewing law firm precedent
- **CHRO**: Intrigued by reduced time-to-productivity metrics

### Enemies/Obstacles
- **Internal recruiters**: "This undermines our jobs. We can fill these roles."
- **HR traditionalists**: "This isn't how hiring works. What about culture fit interviews?"
- **Budget committee**: "You want to pay 4 people as a package? What's the discount?"
- **Her own process**: Existing ATS doesn't have a "team application" workflow

### Support Needed
- ROI calculator showing team hire economics
- Legal precedent documentation
- Integration playbook for team onboarding
- Success stories from similar companies

---

## 6. Transformation (The Ordeal)

### Key Decision Points

**Decision 1: Pitch it internally**
Sarah had to convince CEO, CFO, and General Counsel that team-based hiring wasn't crazy. She prepared a 10-slide deck with Groysberg research, law firm examples, and ROI projections.

**Decision 2: First expression of interest**
After 2 weeks of browsing, Sarah sent her first EOI to Alex Chen's team. Nerve-wracking: what if they said no?

**Decision 3: Negotiate as a package**
Finance wanted to negotiate individually with each team member. Sarah pushed back: "We're buying a team, not 4 individuals. One package, one deal."

**Decision 4: Fast-track the process**
Standard NextGen interview process: 5 rounds over 6 weeks. Sarah got approval for a compressed 2-week process for team hires.

### Moments of Doubt
- **Week 1**: Only 3 teams matched her criteria. "Is the supply side too thin?"
- **Week 3**: TechFlow team's salary ask was 15% above budget. "Are we getting played?"
- **Week 4**: One team member (Marcus) had a GitHub controversy from 2019. "Is this team actually vetted?"
- **Week 6**: Legal review took 3 weeks. CEO asked if she'd "given up on the unconventional approach."

### What Kept Her Going
1. **CEO buy-in**: He'd publicly endorsed the approach. Backing out would be visible failure.
2. **Early signal**: TechFlow team's response was enthusiastic and professional
3. **Comparative math**: 6 individual hires would take 6-8 months. This could close in 8 weeks.
4. **Gut instinct**: The TechFlow team's cohesion was visible in how they communicated

### Breakthroughs
- **Joint interview**: All 4 TechFlow members interviewed together. Chemistry was undeniable.
- **Reference check**: 3 references independently called them "the best team I've worked with"
- **Offer acceptance**: All 4 signed within 48 hours. No negotiation drama.
- **Day 15**: Team delivered first analytics dashboard. CEO texted Sarah: "Best hire we've made."

---

## 7. The Reward (Best Outcome)

### Ideal End State

**For NextGen**:
- Analytics division operational in 45 days (half the CEO's deadline)
- First major project delivered in 90 days
- $2.3M revenue impact attributed to analytics insights in year 1
- Zero attrition from the team in 18 months

**For Sarah**:
- Promoted to SVP of Talent (expanded scope)
- Board presentation cited as "innovative talent strategy"
- Built internal playbook for team-based hiring
- Became go-to expert on liftouts in YPO network

**For the Acquired Team**:
- All 4 members got 25-35% compensation increases
- Executive visibility they never had at TechFlow
- Greenfield opportunity to build from scratch
- Maintained their working relationships

### Quantified Success Metrics
| Metric | Individual Hire Path | Team Hire Path |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| Time to fill all roles | 6-8 months | 8 weeks |
| Time to productivity | 12+ months | 15 days |
| First project delivery | Month 18 | Month 3 |
| Cost per productive-hour Y1 | $380/hr | $210/hr |
| Attrition risk | ~30% per role | <5% (team) |
| Total cost (salary + recruiting) | $1.9M | $1.6M |

### Emotional Transformation
- **Before**: "I have to choose between speed and quality"
- **After**: "Team-based hiring gave me both"

### What Sarah Tells Others
> "I was trying to hire 6 data scientists individually. 90-day deadline, $2M budget, CEO breathing down my neck. Then I discovered Liftout. I hired an intact team of 4 who'd worked together for 3.5 years. They were productive in 15 days. First major deliverable in 90 days. Best talent decision I've ever made. I'm never going back to individual hiring for senior teams."

---

## 8. Risk Analysis

### Best Case Scenario ✅
**Outcome**: Team hits the ground running. First deliverable in 60 days. CEO showcases the hire at all-hands. Sarah promoted, becomes internal champion for liftout strategy. NextGen acquires 2 more teams in the next year using the playbook she built.

**Probability**: 30%

**Why it could happen**:
- Team has documented track record
- NextGen has resources to support fast integration
- CEO is already bought in on the approach

### Worst Case Scenario ❌
**Outcome**: Team arrives, but one member (Marcus) doesn't integrate well culturally. Creates friction with existing engineering team. After 6 months, he leaves. Team chemistry fractures. Two others follow within a year. $1.6M spent, division still understaffed.

**Probability**: 10%

**Why it's unlikely**:
- Cultural fit assessment during interview process
- Team's 3.5-year history suggests durability
- Liftout teams have 96% retention at 12 months (industry data)
- Integration support reduces friction

### Most Likely Scenario 📊
**Outcome**: Team integrates successfully but with some bumps. First 30 days require more management attention than expected. One team member negotiates a title adjustment after 90 days. First project delivered in 4 months (not 3). Year-one ROI is positive but not transformative. Sarah is seen as innovative, but team-based hiring remains "experimental" at NextGen.

**Probability**: 55%

**Why this is realistic**:
- Integration always has friction
- Timelines usually slip somewhat
- Full organizational buy-in takes time
- Success creates proof, not revolution

### Mitigation Strategies
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Cultural mismatch | Structured integration plan, 30/60/90 check-ins |
| Budget overrun | Negotiate package deal, not individual salaries |
| Executive skepticism | ROI tracking from day 1, weekly updates |
| Team fragmentation post-hire | Preserve team structure, don't split them up |

## 11. Failure Modes: When Team Members Back Out (Company Perspective)

### The Marcus Scenario—From Sarah's View

**Week 6 of the process**: Alex calls Sarah with news. One team member, Marcus, has family circumstances that prevent him from joining immediately.

Sarah's internal reaction: "Here we go. This is why people say team hiring doesn't work."

### Sarah's Crisis Decision Tree

```
Team member backs out
    │
    ├── Option A: Proceed with 3-person team
    │   ├── Pro: Still get team chemistry, faster than 3 individual hires
    │   ├── Con: Missing critical MLOps capability
    │   ├── Con: Team's cohesion score drops
    │   └── Risk: CEO asks why we're paying "team premium" for 3 people
    │
    ├── Option B: Wait for Marcus
    │   ├── Pro: Get the full team as planned
    │   ├── Con: 90-day deadline—can't wait 6 months
    │   ├── Con: Board presentation is immovable
    │   └── Risk: Other team members get cold feet while waiting
    │
    ├── Option C: Require team to find replacement
    │   ├── Pro: Maintains team capability profile
    │   ├── Con: New person isn't vetted through platform
    │   ├── Con: Defeats the "proven chemistry" value prop
    │   └── Risk: Delays process, team may walk away
    │
    └── Option D: Walk away from the deal
        ├── Pro: Avoid the risk, try again with another team
        ├── Con: 6 weeks wasted, back to individual hiring
        ├── Con: Proves skeptics right about team hiring
        └── Risk: CEO loses confidence in the approach
```

### How Sarah Actually Handles It

**Step 1: Don't panic**
Sarah reminds herself: "One person pausing isn't a dealbreaker. In individual hiring, candidates drop out all the time."

**Step 2: Assess the gap**
She asks Alex: "What does Marcus bring that the others can't cover?" Answer: MLOps and infrastructure. Critical, but not irreplaceable.

**Step 3: Creative solution**
Sarah proposes the "Phase 2" approach: "What if we hire the three of you now, bring in a senior MLOps contractor for 6 months, and Marcus joins when he's ready? We'll hold his role."

**Step 4: Get internal buy-in**
Sarah pitches the CEO: "We're getting 75% of the team now, 100% in 6 months. Still faster than individual hiring."

CEO: "Do it. But I want Marcus committed in writing."

**Step 5: Formalize the arrangement**
- 3-person offer signed immediately
- Contractor sourced for MLOps coverage
- Written commitment from Marcus with 6-month timeline
- Compensation package held at original levels

### What Sarah Learned

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Teams aren't all-or-nothing | Partial teams still valuable |
| Flexibility closes deals | Rigid processes kill them |
| Contractor bridge works | Fill gaps while waiting |
| CEO needs updates | Surprises are worse than setbacks |

### Red Flags Sarah Now Watches For

| Signal | Risk Level | Action |
|--------|------------|--------|
| One member "not sure" during interviews | High | Probe deeper, don't ignore |
| Significantly different salary expectations within team | Medium | May indicate misalignment |
| Team lead can't explain why members are committed | High | Team may not be as solid as claimed |
| Recent team composition change | Medium | Chemistry may be overstated |
| One member never joins group calls | High | May already be disengaging |

### Product Implications (Company Side)

| Need | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Team commitment verification | Pre-interview commitment confirmations |
| Partial team offers | Support offers to subset of team |
| Phased hiring option | "Phase 2" member status |
| Risk indicators | Cohesion changes flagged to companies |
| Contingency templates | Contract language for delayed joiners |

## 12. Geographic & Remote Work Dynamics (Company Perspective)

### Sarah's Challenge: NYC HQ, SF Team

NextGen Financial is headquartered in New York. The TechFlow team is in San Francisco. Sarah has to navigate:

1. **Executive expectations**: CEO wants "butts in seats"
2. **Team constraints**: Sarah Martinez (team member) can't relocate
3. **Budget reality**: Relocation packages are expensive
4. **Cultural questions**: How do remote teams integrate with HQ culture?

### The Internal Debate

**CEO's position**: "If we're paying team premium, I want them in our office building relationships."

**CTO's position**: "The best data science teams are distributed. We need to modernize."

**CFO's position**: "Relocation for 4 people = $200K. Is it worth it?"

**Sarah's position**: "The value is in their chemistry, not their zip code."

### Sarah's Negotiation Framework

**Step 1: Understand team constraints first**
Before making demands, Sarah asks Alex: "What's everyone's geographic flexibility?"

**Step 2: Find the non-negotiables**
- Alex: Can relocate (partner is mobile)
- Sarah M: Cannot relocate (aging parents)
- Marcus: Cannot relocate (wife's job)
- Priya: Open to anything

**Step 3: Design hybrid solution**
Sarah proposes to leadership:

| Component | Arrangement | Cost |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Alex | NYC 1 week/month | ~$30K/year travel |
| Team onsites | Quarterly in NYC | ~$20K/quarter |
| SF co-working | Team maintains local base | $24K/year |
| Integration trips | First 90 days intensive | $15K one-time |

**Total annual cost**: ~$150K vs. $200K for relocation
**Benefit**: Team stays intact, keeps their support systems

### The "Integration Without Relocation" Playbook

Sarah develops a playbook for remote team integration:

**Week 1-2: Intensive NYC onsite**
- All 4 team members in NYC
- Meet every executive
- Shadow existing teams
- Cultural immersion

**Month 1-3: Structured touchpoints**
- Weekly video all-hands
- Monthly NYC visit (rotating team members)
- Dedicated Slack channel with exec sponsors
- 30/60/90 day check-ins

**Ongoing: Rhythm maintenance**
- Quarterly full-team NYC onsites
- Annual company offsite attendance
- Regular pairing with NYC-based colleagues

### What Works for Remote Liftouts

| Practice | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Intensive onboarding onsite | Builds relationships that sustain remote work |
| Executive sponsorship | Remote teams need visible advocates |
| Outcome-based management | Don't measure hours, measure output |
| Preserved team rituals | Let them keep their existing practices |
| Investment in travel | Cheaper than relocation, maintains connection |

### What Fails

| Mistake | Consequence |

## 13. Compensation Negotiation Dynamics (Company Perspective)

### Sarah's Dilemma: Package vs. Individual Pricing

Finance wants to negotiate individually: "We should get a discount for buying 4. And Sarah Martinez is worth more than Marcus—let's pay accordingly."

Sarah pushes back: "If we create salary asymmetry, we're starting with a trust deficit. The team will find out. They always do."

### The Economics Sarah Presents to CFO

**Scenario A: Individual Hiring (Traditional)**
| Role | Salary | Recruiter Fee (20%) | Ramp Cost (6 mo) | Total Y1 |
|------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| VP Analytics | $380K | $76K | $95K | $551K |
| Sr Data Scientist | $320K | $64K | $80K | $464K |
| ML Engineer | $290K | $58K | $72.5K | $420.5K |
| Data Manager | $200K | $40K | $50K | $290K |
| **Total** | $1.19M | $238K | $297.5K | **$1.725M** |

**Scenario B: Team Hire (Liftout)**
| Role | Salary | Platform Fee (8%) | Ramp Cost (2 wk) | Total Y1 |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| VP Analytics | $380K | - | $14.6K | $394.6K |
| Sr Data Scientist | $320K | - | $12.3K | $332.3K |
| ML Engineer | $290K | - | $11.2K | $301.2K |
| Data Manager | $200K | - | $7.7K | $207.7K |
| Platform fee | - | $95.2K | - | $95.2K |
| **Total** | $1.19M | $95.2K | $45.8K | **$1.331M** |

**Savings**: $394K (23% less)

### Sarah's Negotiation Principles

**Principle 1: One conversation, one package**
"We're not going to run 4 parallel negotiations. Tell me what the team needs as a unit."

**Principle 2: Market-rate, not discount-rate**
"They're not giving us a volume discount. They're giving us proven chemistry. Pay market."

**Principle 3: Equity pool, not individual grants**
"We'll allocate an equity pool. The team leader can propose the split. Less negotiation friction."

**Principle 4: Signing bonus if needed**
"If we're 10% under their ask, a signing bonus is cheaper than losing the deal."

### The Actual Negotiation

**TechFlow team's ask**:
| Role | Salary | Equity |
|------|--------|--------|
| Alex | $400K | $100K/year |
| Sarah M | $330K | $75K/year |
| Marcus | $300K | $60K/year |
| Priya | $220K | $40K/year |
| **Total** | $1.25M | $275K/year |

**NextGen's initial budget**: $1.1M salary, $200K equity/year

**The gap**: $150K salary, $75K equity

**Sarah's solution**:
- Meet salary asks for Alex and Sarah M (senior talent premium)
- Come in slightly under for Marcus and Priya (junior flexibility)
- Add $50K signing bonus pool to bridge remaining gap
- Equity pool at $240K/year (split by team internally)

**Final package**:
| Role | Salary | Signing | Equity |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| Alex | $380K | $25K | $96K/year |
| Sarah M | $320K | $15K | $72K/year |
| Marcus | $290K | $7K | $48K/year |
| Priya | $200K | $3K | $24K/year |
| **Total** | $1.19M | $50K | $240K/year |

**Total comp Year 1**: $1.48M (vs. $1.525M ask = 3% gap)

### What Sarah Got Right

| Practice | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Package negotiation | Preserved team trust |
| Signing bonus flexibility | Closed the gap without recurring cost |
| Equity pool approach | Let team handle internal fairness |
| Transparency about budget | Team understood constraints |

### What Companies Get Wrong

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Lowballing one person | Word gets out, team resentment |
| Hiding total comp from team | Breeds distrust before day one |
| Taking too long on approval | Team loses confidence, explores other options |
| Treating lead as sole negotiator | Other members feel undervalued |

### Product Implications (Company Side)

| Need | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Package offer builder | Structure team offers as one unit |
| Budget modeling | Show total cost vs. individual hire path |
| Approval workflow | Multi-stakeholder sign-off for team packages |
| Offer comparison | Benchmark against market team rates |
| Negotiation templates | Scripts for package-based conversations |

## 14. Post-Hire Structure Conflicts (Company Perspective)

### Sarah's Challenge: Where Does This Team Fit?

The TechFlow team arrives. But NextGen has existing structures:

- **VP of Engineering** (5-year tenure) expects to manage all technical hires
- **Head of Analytics** (individual contributor path) feels threatened
- **CTO** promised Alex direct reporting—but didn't tell VP Engineering

Sarah is caught in the middle of an org chart collision.

### The Conflict Map

```
What was promised:
CEO
 └── CTO
      └── Alex (VP Analytics) ← Direct to CTO
           └── Team

What VP Engineering expects:
CEO
 └── CTO
      └── VP Engineering
           └── Alex (Director) ← Under his org
                └── Team

What Head of Analytics fears:
CEO
 └── CTO
      └── VP Engineering
           └── Head of Analytics ← Being bypassed
      └── Alex (VP Analytics) ← Parallel, threatening
           └── Team
```

### Sarah's Mediation Role

**Step 1: Acknowledge the mess**
Sarah to CTO: "We have three people expecting different org structures. We need to resolve this before Alex's first day, or we'll lose them."

**Step 2: Understand each stakeholder's fear**
- **VP Engineering**: "Am I being demoted? Is Alex my replacement?"
- **Head of Analytics**: "Am I being managed out?"
- **Alex**: "I was promised executive access. Are you reneging?"

**Step 3: Design a solution that addresses fears**
Sarah proposes:

```
CEO
 └── CTO
      ├── VP Engineering (unchanged scope)
      │    └── Platform Engineering
      │    └── Infrastructure
      │
      └── Alex (VP Analytics) ← Reports to CTO, parallel to VP Eng
           └── Data Science Team
           └── Head of Analytics (moved) ← Growth path, not threat
```

**Key elements**:
- VP Engineering keeps his scope—Alex doesn't encroach
- Alex gets CTO reporting as promised
- Head of Analytics becomes Alex's first direct report (promotion)
- Clear swim lanes prevent territorial conflict

### The First 90 Days: Preventing Fragmentation

Sarah's integration checklist to protect team integrity:

| Day | Risk | Sarah's Action |
|-----|------|----------------|
| 1 | Reporting confusion | Written org chart, shared company-wide |
| 7 | Political undermining | 1:1 with VP Engineering to affirm his role |
| 14 | Scope creep | Document Alex's mandate in writing |
| 30 | Team splitting requests | Pre-emptive conversation with CTO |
| 60 | Culture clash | Anonymous pulse survey of team |
| 90 | Success attribution | Public credit at all-hands |

### The "Team Integrity Clause"

Sarah learned from a previous liftout failure. She now requires offer letters to include:

> "For the first 18 months of employment, the Analytics team will remain intact as a unit reporting to [Alex Chen]. Any proposed changes to team composition or reporting structure require mutual written agreement between the team lead and the company."

**Legal's reaction**: "This is unusual."

**Sarah's response**: "So is hiring an intact team. Unusual protections for unusual value."

### What Companies Get Wrong Post-Hire

| Mistake | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| No org chart clarity | Power struggles from day one |
| Existing managers feel threatened | Sabotage, information hoarding |
| Splitting team "for development" | Destroys the chemistry they paid for |
| Changing scope without discussion | Team lead loses credibility with team |
| Treating team like individual hires | Misses integration as a unit |

### What Sarah Gets Right

| Practice | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Pre-arrival org clarity | No surprises on day one |
| Stakeholder fear mapping | Addresses politics proactively |
| Written team integrity clause | Legal protection against splitting |
| Executive alignment | CTO, VP Eng, Sarah all on same page |
| Integration as unit | Preserves the value proposition |

### Product Implications (Company Side)

| Need | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Org structure planning | Tools for mapping where team fits |
| Stakeholder impact analysis | Who's affected by new team? |
| Team integrity templates | Contract language for protection |
| Integration milestone tracking | 30/60/90 day check-ins built in |
| Conflict early warning | Signals that team is being marginalized |

## 15. Industry-Specific Variations (Company Perspective)

### How Sarah's Playbook Changes by Industry

Sarah is in FinTech. But company-side liftout dynamics vary significantly:

### Technology / FinTech (Sarah's World)

| Factor | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline pressure | Intense—90 day deadlines common |
| Budget flexibility | Equity-heavy, creative structuring |
| Legal complexity | Low (especially CA) |
| Existing team reaction | Generally welcoming |
| Integration support | High—onboarding infrastructure exists |
| Remote acceptance | High |
| Decision makers | CEO + CTO, fast approval |

### Investment Banking

| Factor | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline pressure | Lower—garden leave expected |
| Budget flexibility | Cash-heavy, guaranteed bonuses |
| Legal complexity | High—garden leave, client conflicts |
| Existing team reaction | Political—book of business matters |
| Integration support | Variable—depends on coverage model |
| Remote acceptance | Low—presence matters for client relationships |
| Decision makers | Division heads, partnership votes |

**Sarah's equivalent in banking**: "I need to budget for 6 months of garden leave salary. The team won't be productive until Q3."

### Law Firms

| Factor | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline pressure | Moderate—ethics clearance required |
| Budget flexibility | Origination credits, PPP implications |
| Legal complexity | Medium—conflicts checks required |
| Existing team reaction | Highly political—affects partner economics |
| Integration support | Varies dramatically by firm |
| Remote acceptance | Moderate post-COVID |
| Decision makers | Managing partner + compensation committee |

**Sarah's equivalent in BigLaw**: "We need a 4-month conflicts check. And the existing partners are worried about dilution."

### Healthcare

| Factor | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline pressure | Very low—credentialing takes 6-18 months |
| Budget flexibility | RVU-based, call schedule complexity |
| Legal complexity | High—non-competes often enforceable |
| Existing team reaction | Group dynamics matter—call rotation |
| Integration support | Heavy—credentialing, privileging, malpractice |
| Remote acceptance | Very low—clinical presence required |
| Decision makers | Medical executive committee, board approval |

**Sarah's equivalent in healthcare**: "Credentialing will take 9 months. The medical staff office needs to approve. And we have to negotiate call schedule integration."

### Consulting

| Factor | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline pressure | Moderate—client engagement cycles |
| Budget flexibility | Partner buy-in, profit share models |
| Legal complexity | Medium—client non-solicitation common |
| Existing team reaction | Depends on practice area overlap |
| Integration support | Moderate—established processes exist |
| Remote acceptance | Client-dependent |
| Decision makers | Managing partners, practice leaders |

**Sarah's equivalent in consulting**: "The team brings a $5M book of business, but we have conflicts with two of their clients."

### What This Means for Sarah

If Sarah were hiring a team in healthcare instead of tech:
- She'd need 12-month runway, not 90 days
- Legal would be much more involved (non-competes, malpractice)
- Integration would require credential transfer support
- Budget would include malpractice insurance transition
- Remote work wouldn't be an option

### Product Implications (Company Side)

| Need | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Industry-specific workflows | Customized processes by sector |
| Timeline calibration | Realistic expectations by industry |
| Legal requirement checklist | Industry-specific compliance |
| Integration playbooks | Sector-appropriate onboarding |
| Compensation modeling | Industry-specific comp structures |
