1. Make the practice accessible to all industries
2. Provide a platform where both sides can find each other confidentially
3. Validate and normalize team-based hiring

## Competitive Positioning

### Direct Competitors
None at scale. Closest:
- **Toplyne** (AI-based team matching) - early stage
- **AngelList Talent** (startup hiring) - individual focused
- **Hired** (tech recruiting) - individual focused

### Indirect Competitors

| Competitor | Their Approach | Our Differentiation |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| LinkedIn | Individual profiles, recruiters | Team-first, confidential |
| Executive search | Individual placement | Team placement |
| Acqui-hire | Buy whole company | Just the team, faster |
| Contract teams | Temporary teams | Permanent employment |

### Positioning Statement

> For high-performing teams who've outgrown their companies, Liftout is the only platform where teams can move together to new opportunities. Unlike individual job boards or executive search, Liftout preserves team chemistry, enables confidential exploration, and helps companies acquire proven teams with day-one productivity.

## Risk Mitigation

### Supply Risk (Not Enough Teams)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Teams won't register | Lead with confidentiality, browse-before-register |
| Team members won't commit | Make team formation easy, show social proof |
| Quality teams aren't on platform | Seed with high-quality teams, verify profiles |

### Demand Risk (Not Enough Companies)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Companies don't know this is possible | Education content, precedent examples |
| Legal concerns block adoption | Provide template contracts, precedent docs |
| Budget concerns | ROI calculator, case studies |

### Marketplace Risk (Chicken & Egg)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Teams wait for demand | Show opportunity volume, match potential |
| Companies wait for supply | Concierge first companies, guarantee quality |
| Neither side commits first | Seed both sides with relationships |
