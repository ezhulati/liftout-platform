## 3. Team Chemistry

### Cohesion Score: 94/100

How this is calculated:

| Factor | Score | Evidence |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Tenure together | 20/20 | 3.5 years continuous collaboration |
| Joint deliveries | 20/20 | 12+ major projects completed together |
| Communication health | 18/20 | Daily standups, low conflict, high trust |
| Complementary skills | 18/20 | No significant skill gaps |
| Shared adversity | 18/20 | Previous liftout (from DataCorp), survived layoffs |

### Why This Cohesion Matters

**For Teams**:
> "We've already done the hard work of learning to disagree productively. We don't need 6 months to form—we're already performing."

**For Companies**:
> "You're not hiring 4 individuals who might not work together. You're hiring a system that already works. Time to value: 2 weeks, not 12 months."

### Team Formation History

```
TIMELINE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2020 Q2: Alex hired at DataCorp
         └─ Started building data science function

2020 Q4: Sarah joins Alex's team at DataCorp
         └─ First hire, immediate chemistry

2021 Q2: Marcus joins (referred by Sarah)
         └─ Infrastructure expertise fills critical gap

2021 Q4: DataCorp acquired by TechFlow
         └─ Team survives as a unit (first liftout)

2022 Q1: Priya joins (Alex's first external hire at TechFlow)
         └─ Completes the team with business focus

2022-2024: 3+ years of continuous collaboration
           └─ 12 major projects, 3 publications, $2.1M impact

2024 Q4: Team decides to explore liftout opportunities
         └─ "We've outgrown TechFlow, but not each other"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### The DataCorp Liftout (Their First Move Together)

In 2021, DataCorp was acquired by TechFlow Analytics. During the acquisition:
- 60% of DataCorp staff was laid off
- Alex's team was explicitly retained as a unit
- TechFlow's CEO: "We're buying the company for this team"

This experience taught them:
1. Their chemistry is visible and valuable to outsiders
2. Moving together is possible
3. They can navigate organizational uncertainty
4. Their collective value exceeds individual value

## 6. Team Dynamics

### How They Work Together

**Daily rhythm**:
```
9:00 AM    Async standup (Slack thread)
           └─ What I did yesterday, what I'm doing today, blockers

10:00 AM   Deep work block (cameras off, Slack muted)
           └─ Individual focus time

12:00 PM   Lunch break (often together, optional)

1:00 PM    Collaboration window
           └─ Pair programming, code reviews, meetings

4:00 PM    Sync-up (15 min video if needed)
           └─ End-of-day coordination

5:30 PM    Wrap-up
           └─ Team respects boundaries—no after-hours Slack
```

**Weekly rhythm**:
- Monday: Sprint planning (1 hour)
- Wednesday: Technical deep-dive (optional attendance)
- Friday: Retrospective (30 min) + demos

### Communication Patterns

| Channel | Usage | Response expectation |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| Slack (team channel) | Quick questions, status updates | Same day |
| Slack (DMs) | Urgent or sensitive | Within 2 hours |
| Email | External communication | Next business day |
| Video call | Complex discussions, decisions | Scheduled in advance |
| In-person | Whiteboarding, relationship building | Monthly (optional) |

### Conflict Resolution

The team has developed a protocol:

1. **Disagree openly**: Technical disagreements happen in the team channel, not in DMs
2. **Assume good intent**: "I think you're wrong" not "you're being difficult"
3. **Data wins**: When opinions conflict, run an experiment
4. **Alex breaks ties**: If truly stuck, team lead decides and team commits
5. **Retrospect, don't relitigate**: After decisions, move forward

**Example conflict** (real):
> Sarah wanted to use a complex transformer model. Marcus said it was impossible to deploy in production. They argued for 2 days. Resolution: Marcus built a lightweight serving solution that met Sarah's accuracy needs at 40% of the compute cost. Both claimed victory.

### Working Styles

| Member | Style | What they need | What they give |
|--------|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Alex | Strategic, protective | Clear goals from leadership | Shields team from politics |
| Sarah | Deep, focused | Uninterrupted research time | Rigorous technical thinking |
| Marcus | Practical, cautious | Realistic timelines | Reliable execution |
| Priya | Collaborative, energetic | Feedback and validation | Stakeholder translation |

---

## 7. Team Requirements

### Compensation Package

| Member | Current | Minimum | Target | Ceiling |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| Alex | $280K | $350K | $380K | $420K |
| Sarah | $240K | $300K | $320K | $350K |
| Marcus | $220K | $260K | $290K | $320K |
| Priya | $160K | $180K | $200K | $220K |
| **Total** | **$900K** | **$1.09M** | **$1.19M** | **$1.31M** |

**Equity expectations**: Team expects equity participation at Series B+ companies. Target: $200-280K/year total team equity vesting.

### Non-Negotiable Requirements

| Requirement | Reason | Owner |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Team moves together | Core value proposition | All |
| Remote work option | Sarah cannot relocate | Sarah |
| 12+ weeks parental leave | Marcus's baby due Q2 | Marcus |
| Management track | Priya's career growth | Priya |
| Executive access | Alex's leadership role | Alex |

### Preferred But Flexible

| Preference | Importance | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Bay Area base | Medium | Remote OK if travel budget exists |
| Series B+ company | Medium | Stability and resources matter |
| FinTech industry | Low | Open to other industries |
| Research time (20%) | Medium | Important to Sarah |
| On-call rotation | High | Marcus needs relief from solo on-call |

### Timeline Constraints

```
TIMELINE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

December 2024: Process starts
              └─ Profile creation, initial outreach

January 2025: Active interviewing
              └─ Must move quickly due to Marcus timeline

February 2025: Decision deadline
              └─ Offers must be finalized by Feb 15

March 2025: Start date window
           └─ Ideal start: March 1-15

April 2025: Marcus's parental leave begins
           └─ Team must be settled before baby arrives

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

---

## 8. Team Availability & Visibility

### Current Status
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Availability** | Available—actively exploring opportunities |
| **Visibility** | Selective (approved companies only) |
| **Response time** | 24-48 hours |

### Companies Blocked
- TechFlow Analytics (current employer)
- DataCorp (former employer)
- Direct competitors in Bay Area fintech analytics

### Ideal Opportunities

**Best fit**:
- Series B+ fintech or data-focused company
- Building or scaling analytics/ML function
- Executive visibility for analytics work
- Remote-friendly or Bay Area-based
- Growth trajectory (not coasting)

**Red flags**:
- "We just need data scientists"—no infrastructure support
- "The team reports to marketing"—analytics as afterthought
- "We want you, Alex, but not the others"—team unbundling
- "We need everyone in NYC full-time"—Sarah's constraint
- "Parental leave is 4 weeks"—Marcus's constraint

---

## 9. The Team's Value Story

### For Investors (The ROI Pitch)

> "This team has documented $2.1M in savings at their current employer. They run 10M+ predictions daily at 99.9% uptime. They've published at NeurIPS and ICML. You're not paying for 4 salaries—you're paying for a production-ready analytics division that works on Day 1."

### For CEOs (The Strategy Pitch)

> "You could spend 8 months hiring 4-6 individuals, then wait another 12 months for them to gel. Or you could hire this team and have a functioning analytics division in 45 days. The question isn't whether you can afford them—it's whether you can afford to wait."

### For CHROs (The Risk Pitch)

> "Individual hires have ~30% first-year attrition. This team has 0% internal attrition over 3.5 years. You're not betting on 4 individuals staying—you're betting on a team that's already proven they stay together."

### For CTOs (The Technical Pitch)

> "Sarah brings Stanford PhD rigor. Marcus brings production-grade MLOps. Alex brings leadership that executives trust. Priya brings business translation that boards understand. You're not getting researchers who can't ship—you're getting a team that publishes *and* deploys."

---

## 10. Failure Modes & Mitigations

### What Could Go Wrong

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Marcus backs out (baby timing) | 20% | High | Phase 2 option, contractor bridge |
| Sarah gets poached individually | 15% | High | Unified commitment, salary match |
| Team doesn't integrate with new culture | 10% | Medium | 90-day check-ins, exec sponsor |
| Priya underperforms in management | 10% | Low | Mentorship, IC fallback option |
| Alex and new executives clash | 10% | High | Clear role definition before start |

### The Marcus Scenario (Detailed)

If Marcus can't join due to baby timing:
1. Team proceeds as 3 (Alex, Sarah, Priya)
2. NextGen hires MLOps contractor for 6 months
3. Marcus joins as "Phase 2" hire when ready
4. Compensation package held at original levels

Team has discussed this explicitly. All members are comfortable with this contingency.

### The "Unbundling" Pressure

If a company says "We want Sarah and Alex, but Marcus and Priya are optional":

**Team response**: "We're a package deal. If you want our chemistry, you take all four. If you want individuals, we're not the right fit."

**Why this matters**: Unbundling destroys the value proposition. The team's chemistry is the product. Breaking it apart defeats the purpose.

## 11. What This Team Needs From an Employer

### Must-Haves

| Need | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Executive sponsor | Team needs advocacy at leadership level |
| Clear mandate | Know what success looks like in 90 days |
| Budget for tools | Can't rebuild infrastructure without resources |
| Team integrity commitment | 18-month clause in offer letter |
| Remote flexibility | Sarah cannot relocate, others prefer hybrid |

### Nice-to-Haves

| Preference | Why It Matters |
|------------|---------------|
| Research time (20%) | Sarah's retention and growth |
| Conference budget | Team stays current, builds network |
| Equity participation | Alignment with company success |
| Modern tech stack | Don't want to fight legacy systems |
| Growth path clarity | Each member needs a trajectory |
