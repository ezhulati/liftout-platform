# Jobs to be Done: Liftout JTBD Analysis

Understanding what users are trying to accomplish through the lens of Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework.

---

## JTBD Framework Overview

Jobs to be Done focuses on the progress users are trying to make in their lives, not just features or demographics. Each "job" has three dimensions:

1. **Functional Jobs** - Practical tasks to complete
2. **Emotional Jobs** - Feelings to achieve or avoid
3. **Social Jobs** - How users want to be perceived by others

## Team User Jobs (Alex Chen archetype)

### Core Job Statement

> **When I** realize I've outgrown my current company **but** don't want to leave my high-performing team behind, **I want to** find opportunities where we can move together **so I can** advance my career without sacrificing the relationships that make me effective.

### Functional Jobs

| Job | Current Solution | Why It Fails |
|-----|------------------|--------------|
| Find better career opportunity | Individual job search | Means leaving team behind |
| Maintain team relationships | Stay at current company | Career stagnates |
| Negotiate better compensation | Individual negotiation | Less leverage alone |
| Evaluate opportunity quality | Read job descriptions | Can't assess if company values teams |
| Coordinate search with team | Text threads, Google Docs | Inefficient, insecure |
| Keep search confidential | Don't tell anyone | Can't involve team |

**Liftout Solution**: Platform designed for teams to explore, coordinate, and move together with anonymity controls.

### Emotional Jobs

| Job | Desired Feeling | Fear to Avoid |
|-----|----------------|---------------|
| Feel loyal | "I'm not abandoning my people" | Guilt of leaving team behind |
| Feel validated | "Our chemistry is worth something" | Imposter syndrome |
| Feel secure | "This won't blow up in my face" | Employer retaliation |
| Feel in control | "I choose when to reveal myself" | Forced transparency |
| Feel excited | "Real opportunity, not fantasy" | Disappointment |
| Feel confident | "I'm making a good decision" | Regret |

### Core Job Statement
