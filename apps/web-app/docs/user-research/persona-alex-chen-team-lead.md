## 2. The Problem (Ordinary World)

### Current Situation
Alex leads a high-performing data science team at TechFlow Analytics. They've been together 3.5 years, survived a previous liftout from DataCorp Inc, and have a cohesion score of 94/100. They've delivered $2.1M in annual savings through predictive modeling.

But TechFlow is stagnating. The company raised a modest Series A two years ago and hasn't grown since. The executive team is risk-averse. Alex sees diminishing career trajectory and limited scope for his team.

### What's Not Working
- **Career ceiling**: Alex has been "VP of Data Science" in title for a year, but still reports to a non-technical COO who doesn't understand their work
- **Limited scope**: Team is stuck doing fraud detection optimization; no pathway to strategic AI initiatives
- **Compensation compression**: Market rates have jumped 25% in 3 years; TechFlow won't match
- **Attrition risk**: Sarah got an offer from Anthropic last month. She stayed for the team, but how long?
- **Innovation blocked**: Every proposal for new ML projects dies in committee

### Failed Alternatives
1. **Individual job search**: Alex got a VP offer at a Series B fintech. $350K + equity. But it meant leaving Sarah, Marcus, and Priya behind. He turned it down.
2. **Internal advocacy**: Pitched a "Strategic AI Lab" to leadership. Got a "maybe next quarter" that's been repeated for 18 months.
3. **Side projects**: Team built an internal tool on weekends that could be productized. Leadership won't spin it out.
4. **Waiting it out**: Hoped TechFlow would get acquired. But no movement in 2 years.

### Emotional State
- **Frustrated**: "I've given this company 5 years. They don't see what we could become."
- **Guilty**: "If I leave, I'm breaking up the best team I've ever built."
- **Anxious**: "Sarah's getting calls from Google every week. I can't lose her."
- **Stuck**: "Individual success feels like betrayal. Staying feels like decay."

### The Core Tension
> "Every career framework tells me to optimize for myself. But my best work happens with this team. Why does advancing mean abandoning them?"

---

## 3. Discovery (Call to Adventure)

### The Trigger
Sarah forwards Alex an article from The American Lawyer about Crowell & Moring hiring 40+ lawyers as a team from Reed Smith. The headline: "Group laterals up 14% as teams refuse to break up."

Alex's reaction: "Wait, this is a thing? Whole teams can move together?"

### How Alex Found Liftout
1. **Week 1**: Googles "team-based hiring" and "group lateral moves tech"
2. **Week 2**: Finds Harvard Business Review article "Lift Outs: How to Acquire a High-Functioning Team" by Boris Groysberg
3. **Week 2**: Discovers Groysberg's "Chasing Stars" research: stars decline 46% when they move alone
4. **Week 3**: Searches "team hiring platform" and finds Liftout
5. **Week 3**: Reads "What is a Liftout?" page, sees 2024-2025 examples

### Initial Skepticism
- "Is this even legal? Won't we get sued?"
- "Companies won't pay 4x to hire a team when they could hire us individually"
- "Our employer will find out we're looking"
- "This sounds too good to be true"

### The Aha Moment
Reading the landing page: **"Your employer never sees you."**

Then: **"Teams that move together negotiate better compensation packages, maintain their track record, and skip the 12-month team-building phase."**

Alex realizes: This isn't about him getting a new job. This is about his team getting a new home.

---

## 4. Why Alex Signed Up (Crossing the Threshold)

### Value Proposition That Resonated
1. **Confidentiality**: "Your employer never knows you're looking" - this was non-negotiable
2. **Team integrity**: "Move together" - the whole point
3. **Leverage**: "Teams negotiate bigger packages" - practical benefit
4. **Validation**: HBR citations, real 2025 examples - this isn't theoretical

### Trust Signals That Mattered
- Harvard Business Review authority
- Real examples: Microsoft/Inflection, Crowell/Reed Smith
- Statistics with sources (Groysberg 46%, SHRM $240K)
- Anonymous browsing before creating profile
- No employer notification promises

### Fears Overcome
| Fear | How Liftout Addressed It |
|------|-------------------------|
| "We'll get found out" | Visibility controls: anonymous, selective, or public |
| "No one hires teams" | 2024-2025 examples proving market exists |
| "We're not valuable enough" | Cohesion scoring shows team's unique value |
| "It's too complicated" | Simple 4-step process |

### What Alex Hoped to Gain
- **For himself**: Executive role with real authority, compensation reset
- **For the team**: Growth opportunities, new challenges, maintained relationships
- **For his career**: Proof that loyalty doesn't mean stagnation

---

## 5. The Journey (Tests, Allies, Enemies)

### Onboarding Experience
**Day 1**: Signs up, chooses "Team Member" path, enters basic info
**Day 2**: Creates team profile, adds members (Sarah, Marcus, Priya)
**Day 3**: Team members confirm their participation
**Week 1**: Completes profile, sets salary expectations, chooses "anonymous" visibility

### First Actions
1. Browsed 3 opportunities without creating profile (researching)
2. Created account after seeing "Lead FinTech Analytics Division" opportunity
3. Invited team members via private links
4. Set team visibility to "anonymous" initially
5. Explored AI matching to see fit scores

### Allies
- **Sarah Martinez**: Enthusiastic co-conspirator, helped recruit Marcus
- **Marcus Johnson**: Initially skeptical, convinced by confidentiality features
- **Priya Patel**: Newest member, excited for growth opportunity
- **The Platform**: AI matching validated their team's market value

### Enemies/Obstacles
- **Their own fear**: First two weeks were spent convincing each other this was real
- **Time constraints**: Had to coordinate around work schedules to build profile
- **Imposter syndrome**: "Are we actually good enough for companies to want us as a unit?"
- **Information asymmetry**: Not knowing which companies were interested until they engaged

### Support Needed
- Clear explanation of confidentiality mechanics
- Examples of successful team transitions
- Validation that their skills were in demand
- Guidance on salary expectations for team packages

---

## 6. Transformation (The Ordeal)

### Key Decision Points

**Decision 1: Tell the team**
Alex had to convince Sarah, Marcus, and Priya to join him on Liftout. This required vulnerability: admitting he was looking to leave, and asking them to take that risk with him.

**Decision 2: Go from anonymous to selective**
After 3 weeks anonymous, Alex switched to "selective visibility" - allowing specific companies to see their profile while blocking competitors.

**Decision 3: Respond to NextGen Financial**
First real inquiry came from Sarah Rodriguez at NextGen. Alex had to decide: was this team ready to actually talk to companies?

**Decision 4: Negotiate as a unit**
NextGen wanted to interview team members separately. Alex pushed back: "We interview together or not at all."

### Moments of Doubt
- **Week 2**: Marcus asked, "What if we get blackballed in the industry for doing this?"
- **Week 4**: Radio silence after first inquiry. Alex wondered if they'd been too aggressive on salary.
- **Week 6**: TechFlow announced a re-org. Alex panicked that their manager knew.
- **Week 8**: Counter-offer from another company wanted only Alex, not the team. Tempting number.

### What Kept Them Going
1. **Mutual accountability**: Once all 4 were on the platform, no one wanted to be the one who quit
2. **Market validation**: AI matching showed 88%+ fit with 3 opportunities
3. **Sarah's conviction**: "I've turned down 5 offers to stay with this team. This is the only way I'd actually move."
4. **Sunk cost**: They'd already done the work of building the profile

### Breakthroughs
- **First interview**: NextGen Financial's VP was clearly excited about getting a "ready-made" team
- **Compensation discussion**: Package for 4 was higher per-person than individual offers they'd received
- **The "we're in" moment**: All 4 team members agreed to accept the offer together

---

## 7. The Reward (Best Outcome)

### Ideal End State

**For Alex**:
- Title: VP of Analytics at NextGen Financial (reports to CTO)
- Compensation: $380K base + $200K equity package
- Authority: Full P&L for analytics division, direct CEO access
- Team: All 4 moved together, intact

**For the Team**:
- Sarah: Senior Principal Data Scientist, $320K + equity, AI research mandate
- Marcus: Principal ML Engineer, $290K + equity, building ML platform from scratch
- Priya: Lead Analytics Manager, $200K + equity, first management role

**For Everyone**:
- 2-week integration period (not 12 months)
- Preserved working relationships
- Immediate productivity on new projects
- Validation that team loyalty can coexist with career growth

### Quantified Success Metrics
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Alex's base salary | $280K | $380K |
| Team average salary | $220K | $295K |
| Equity value (4-year) | $0 | ~$800K total |
| Time to productivity | N/A | 2 weeks |
| Team cohesion score | 94 | 94 (maintained) |
| Career trajectory | Stalled | Executive track |

### Emotional Transformation
- **Before**: "I have to choose between my career and my team"
- **After**: "My loyalty to my team WAS my competitive advantage"

### What Alex Tells Others
> "I almost took a job that meant leaving my team behind. I'm so glad I found Liftout instead. We moved together to NextGen, all four of us got better titles and compensation, and we hit the ground running because we already knew how to work together. The companies bidding on us understood that our chemistry was worth paying for."

---

## 8. Risk Analysis

### Best Case Scenario ✅
**Outcome**: Team moves to high-growth company with 35%+ compensation increase, executive titles, and expanded scope. Integration takes 2 weeks. Team delivers first major project in 90 days. NextGen credits their success to the liftout model and becomes a case study.

**Probability**: 25%

**Why it could happen**:
- Strong market demand for data science teams
- Alex's team has documented track record
- NextGen is actively seeking team-based hires

### Worst Case Scenario ❌
**Outcome**: Word gets out that Alex's team is looking. TechFlow's CEO learns about the Liftout profile (through leaked screenshot or industry gossip). Confrontation leads to termination. Team is blackballed in SF data science community. Liftout process takes 6 months and fails.

**Probability**: 5%

**Why it's unlikely**:
- Anonymous/selective visibility protects identity
- No employer notification in system
- Non-compete litigation rare in California
- Companies want to hire teams, not punish them

### Most Likely Scenario 📊
**Outcome**: Team spends 3-4 months on Liftout. Receives 4-6 inquiries. Goes through 2 full interview processes. Accepts offer from second-choice company (not quite as prestigious as dream job, but still a significant upgrade). 20-25% compensation increase per person. Move takes 3 weeks including notice period. Minor awkwardness at TechFlow but no retaliation.

**Probability**: 60%

**Why this is realistic**:
- Market exists but still maturing
- Not every company is ready for team hiring
- Process takes longer than individual job search
- Outcomes still better than individual moves

### Mitigation Strategies
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Employer discovery | Keep visibility anonymous until serious |
| Low response rate | Optimize profile, adjust expectations |
| Team fragmentation | Regular check-ins, shared goals |
| Negotiation breakdown | Have backup opportunities in pipeline |

## Appendix: Alex's Decision Matrix

When evaluating opportunities, Alex weighs:

| Factor | Weight | NextGen Score | Alternative Score |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Team moves together | 30% | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (Alex only) |
| Compensation increase | 20% | ✅ 35% bump | ✅ 40% bump |
| Executive authority | 20% | ✅ Reports to CTO | ⚠️ Reports to VP |
| Growth trajectory | 15% | ✅ Series B rocket ship | ⚠️ Stable but slow |
| Technical challenges | 10% | ✅ Greenfield ML platform | ⚠️ Legacy systems |
| Location/remote | 5% | ✅ Hybrid SF/NY | ❌ Full onsite NYC |

**Result**: NextGen wins despite lower individual compensation because team integrity is weighted highest.

## 11. Failure Modes: When Team Members Back Out

### The Marcus Scenario

**Week 6 of the Liftout process**: Marcus gets cold feet.

His wife is 7 months pregnant. His current employer just announced a parental leave extension. The stability of TechFlow suddenly looks more appealing than the risk of a liftout.

Marcus texts Alex: "I don't think I can do this right now. Can you go without me?"

### Alex's Crisis Decision Tree

```
Marcus backs out
    │
    ├── Option A: Proceed as 3-person team
    │   ├── Pro: Keep momentum, don't lose NextGen opportunity
    │   ├── Con: Team loses MLOps expertise (critical capability)
    │   ├── Con: Cohesion score drops from 94 to ~78
    │   └── Risk: NextGen may reduce offer or withdraw
    │
    ├── Option B: Pause and convince Marcus
    │   ├── Pro: Preserve team integrity
    │   ├── Con: NextGen has 90-day deadline—can't wait
    │   ├── Con: Creates resentment if Marcus feels pressured
    │   └── Risk: Other team members lose faith
    │
    ├── Option C: Find MLOps replacement
    │   ├── Pro: Maintains team capability
    │   ├── Con: New person has no history with team
    │   ├── Con: Defeats the purpose of liftout model
    │   └── Risk: Looks desperate to hiring company
    │
    └── Option D: Abort mission
        ├── Pro: No hard feelings, try again later
        ├── Con: Wasted 6 weeks of effort
        ├── Con: May not get this opportunity again
        └── Risk: Team members pursue individual paths
```

### How Alex Actually Handles It

**Step 1: Emergency team meeting (same day)**
Alex calls Sarah and Priya. No judgment on Marcus—just facts. "Marcus needs to pause. What do we want to do?"

**Step 2: Honest conversation with Marcus**
Alex meets Marcus for coffee. "I'm not going to pressure you. Your family comes first. But I need to know: is this a 'not now' or a 'not ever'?"

Marcus: "Honestly? It's the timing. If this were 6 months from now, I'd be in."

**Step 3: Transparent communication with NextGen**
Alex tells Sarah Rodriguez at NextGen: "One of our team members has a family situation. We can proceed as three, or we can ask for 60 days to reassess. What works for you?"

**Step 4: Creative solution emerges**
NextGen's response surprises everyone: "What if Marcus joins in 6 months as a 'Phase 2' hire? We'll hold the ML platform lead role. Meanwhile, we'll bring in a contractor to cover the gap."

### Outcome Variations

| Scenario | Probability | Result |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Marcus rejoins in 6 months | 40% | Best case—team reunites, trust strengthened |
| Marcus stays at TechFlow permanently | 30% | Team grieves, moves on. Still 3-person success. |
| Deal falls through | 20% | NextGen can't wait. Team regroups, finds another opportunity. |
| Team fragments entirely | 10% | Each person pursues individual path. Liftout fails. |

### What This Reveals About Alex

- **Leadership tested**: How he handles Marcus's exit defines his character
- **Flexibility required**: Rigid "all or nothing" thinking kills deals
- **Trust is fragile**: One person's doubt can cascade
- **Communication is everything**: Transparency with NextGen preserved the relationship

### Product Implications

| Need | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Graceful team changes | Allow "pending" status for team members |
| Partial team offers | Companies can express interest in team minus one |
| Timeline flexibility | "Available in X months" status |
| Replacement suggestions | AI matching for capability gaps |
| Communication templates | Scripts for difficult conversations |

---

## 12. Geographic & Remote Work Dynamics

### Alex's Situation: SF Team, NYC Opportunity

Alex's team is based in San Francisco. NextGen Financial is headquartered in New York. This creates complexity:

### The Geography Matrix

| Team Member | Current Location | Relocation Willingness | Remote Preference |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Alex | SF | Yes (partner is mobile) | Hybrid OK |
| Sarah | SF | No (aging parents) | Full remote required |
| Marcus | SF | No (wife's job) | Full remote required |
| Priya | SF | Maybe (open to adventure) | Hybrid OK |

### Negotiation Dynamics

**NextGen's initial position**: "We need at least the team lead onsite in NYC 3 days/week."

**Alex's counter**: "Our team's chemistry was built working hybrid. If you split us geographically, you lose what you're paying for."

**The compromise**:
- Alex: NYC 1 week/month, otherwise remote
- Quarterly team onsites in NYC (all 4, company-paid)
- Sarah, Marcus, Priya: Full remote with annual NYC presence
- Team maintains SF co-working space (NextGen-subsidized)

### Remote-First Liftout Considerations

| Factor | In-Person Team | Distributed Team |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Cohesion proof | Easier (same office history) | Harder (need async work samples) |
| Company appeal | Higher (plug-and-play) | Lower (still need coordination) |
| Compensation | Location-adjusted | Complicates package negotiations |
| Integration | Simpler (all relocate) | Complex (multiple arrangements) |
| Failure modes | All-or-nothing relocation | Individual arrangements can vary |

### The "Hub and Spoke" Model

Some liftouts work best when the team commits to a rhythm:

```
WEEKLY
├── Async work: Mon-Thu (team works remotely from anywhere)
├── Sync day: Friday (all-hands video, planning)
└── Slack always-on for quick decisions

MONTHLY
├── Week 1: NYC onsite (full team at HQ)
└── Weeks 2-4: Distributed work

QUARTERLY
└── Team offsite (non-work location, relationship maintenance)
```

### Alex's Remote Work Philosophy

> "We built our chemistry in a hybrid environment. The magic isn't about being in the same room—it's about shared context, trust, and knowing how each person thinks. That translates to remote if you're intentional about it."

### Product Implications

| Need | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Location flexibility | Team profiles show remote/hybrid/onsite preferences |
| Geographic matching | Filter opportunities by remote-friendliness |
| Distributed team validation | Cohesion scoring for remote-first teams |
| Relocation support | Flag which members would relocate |
| Compensation calculator | Multi-location package modeling |

---

## 13. Compensation Negotiation Dynamics

### The Core Question: Who Negotiates?

When a team moves together, individual negotiation creates problems:
- **Information asymmetry**: What if Sarah finds out Alex got 40% more?
- **Resentment risk**: Different raises = different perceived value
- **Company exploitation**: Divide and conquer on salary

### Alex's Negotiation Framework

**Principle 1: Unified front**
"We negotiate as a team. One conversation, one package. If you want to talk to us individually about compensation, we're not the right fit."

**Principle 2: Transparent bands**
Alex shares salary expectations with the team before any company conversation:
- Alex: $350-400K
- Sarah: $280-330K
- Marcus: $260-300K
- Priya: $180-220K

Everyone knows everyone's range. No surprises.

**Principle 3: Proportional increases**
The team agrees: everyone gets the same percentage increase (not the same dollar amount). If Alex gets 35%, everyone gets 35%.

### The Negotiation Conversation

**NextGen's first offer**:
| Role | Current | Offer | Increase |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| Alex | $280K | $350K | 25% |
| Sarah | $240K | $280K | 17% |
| Marcus | $220K | $260K | 18% |
| Priya | $160K | $185K | 16% |

**Alex's response**: "We appreciate the offer. But Sarah is our most senior IC, and her increase is lowest. We'd like to see the increases aligned."

**NextGen's revised offer**:
| Role | Current | Offer | Increase |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| Alex | $280K | $380K | 36% |
| Sarah | $240K | $320K | 33% |
| Marcus | $220K | $290K | 32% |
| Priya | $160K | $200K | 25% |

**Why Priya is lower**: She's the most junior. The team agrees this is fair—she's getting her first management title, which is worth more than a few percentage points.

### Equity Negotiation

Equity is trickier. Different vesting schedules, different strike prices.

Alex's approach:
- Negotiate total equity pool for the team
- Divide internally based on seniority and role
- Make division transparent before signing

**The Math**:
- Total equity pool: $800K over 4 years
- Alex: 40% ($320K)
- Sarah: 30% ($240K)
- Marcus: 20% ($160K)
- Priya: 10% ($80K)

### What Companies Get Wrong

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Negotiating individually | Creates information asymmetry, team resentment |
| Offering different % increases | Signals who they "really" want |
| Hiding equity splits | Breeds distrust before day one |
| Treating lead as spokesperson only | Undervalues team input |

### What Alex Gets Right

| Practice | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Unified negotiation | Preserves team trust |
| Transparent bands | No surprises |
| Proportional increases | Fairness principle |
| Equity pool approach | Team owns the division |

### Product Implications

| Need | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Package modeling | Calculator for team vs. individual offers |
| Negotiation guidance | Templates for unified team negotiation |
| Compensation transparency | Tools for internal team alignment |
| Market data | Benchmarks for team packages |

## 14. Post-Hire Structure Conflicts

### The Reporting Line Problem

Alex's deal with NextGen: Report to CTO, full P&L for analytics division.

**What Alex expected**:
```
CEO
 └── CTO
      └── Alex (VP Analytics)
           ├── Sarah
           ├── Marcus
           └── Priya
```

**What NextGen actually wanted (revealed in week 2)**:
```
CEO
 └── CTO
      └── VP Engineering (existing)
           └── Alex (Director Analytics)
                ├── Sarah
                ├── Marcus
                └── Priya
```

### The Conflict

Alex signed expecting CTO-level visibility. Now he's being slotted under an existing VP who wasn't part of the hiring conversation.

**Why this happens**:
- Hiring manager (Sarah Rodriguez) isn't the reporting manager
- Org chart politics invisible during recruitment
- Existing executives feel threatened by incoming team
- "VP" title means different things at different companies

### Alex's Response Options

| Option | Action | Risk |
|--------|--------|------|
| Accept it | Take the Director title, prove yourself | Sets bad precedent, team sees you compromised |
| Escalate | Go back to Sarah Rodriguez, demand original terms | Burns bridges before starting |
| Negotiate | Accept VP Engineering reporting, but with direct CTO access | Middle ground, still subordinate |
| Walk away | Reject offer, restart search | 8 weeks wasted, team demoralized |

### What Actually Happened

Alex requested a conversation with the CTO directly.

**Alex's pitch**: "I understood I'd be reporting to you. If the structure has changed, I need to understand why—and what it means for my team's autonomy."

**CTO's response**: "The VP Engineering reporting was HR's idea for headcount management. I want you in my staff meeting. Let's make it a dotted line to VP Engineering, solid line to me."

**Compromise achieved**:
```
CEO
 └── CTO
      └── Alex (VP Analytics) ←── solid line
      └── VP Engineering ←── dotted line (coordination only)

Alex's team
 ├── Sarah
 ├── Marcus
 └── Priya
```

### Team Structure Preservation

The bigger risk: What if NextGen wants to split up the team?

**Scenario**: After 6 months, VP Engineering says "Sarah's NLP skills would be better used in our search team. Can we move her?"

## 15. Industry-Specific Variations

### How Alex's Journey Differs by Industry

Alex is in FinTech. But liftouts work differently across industries:

### Tech/AI (Alex's World)

| Factor | Tech Pattern |
|--------|--------------|
| Non-competes | Rare (especially California) |
| Team identity | Product/project-based |
| Trigger | Acquihires, startup shutdowns, layoffs |
| Timeline | 4-8 weeks from first contact to offer |
| Compensation | Heavy equity component |
| Remote work | Highly flexible |
| Example | Microsoft hiring Inflection AI team |

### Investment Banking

| Factor | Banking Pattern |
|--------|-----------------|
| Non-competes | Garden leave (3-6 months paid) |
| Team identity | Client relationship-based |
| Trigger | Bonus disappointment, leadership change |
| Timeline | 6-12 months (garden leave delays) |
| Compensation | Guaranteed bonus for 2+ years |
| Remote work | Minimal flexibility |
| Example | Entire M&A team moving from Goldman to Centerview |

### Law Firms

| Factor | Law Pattern |
|--------|-------------|
| Non-competes | Generally unenforceable for lawyers |
| Team identity | Practice group + client book |
| Trigger | Partnership disputes, lateral recruiting |
| Timeline | 2-4 months (ethical notice requirements) |
| Compensation | Origination credit, PPP points |
| Remote work | Increasingly flexible post-COVID |
| Example | Reed Smith partners moving to Crowell & Moring |

### Healthcare

| Factor | Healthcare Pattern |
|--------|-------------------|
| Non-competes | Varies by state, often enforceable |
| Team identity | Care team, surgical group, practice |
| Trigger | Hospital system changes, private equity rollups |
| Timeline | 6-18 months (credential transfer, panel re-enrollment) |
| Compensation | RVU-based, call schedule value |
| Remote work | Limited (clinical presence required) |
| Example | Orthopedic surgery group leaving hospital for ASC |

### Consulting

| Factor | Consulting Pattern |
|--------|-------------------|
| Non-competes | 6-12 month non-solicitation |
| Team identity | Client engagement team |
| Trigger | Partner defection, practice shutdown |
| Timeline | 3-6 months |
| Compensation | Partner buy-in, profit share |
| Remote work | Client-dependent |
| Example | McKinsey team joining client company |

### What This Means for Alex

If Alex were in banking instead of tech:
- He'd need to plan for 6-month garden leave
- Compensation would emphasize guaranteed bonus over equity
- Client relationships would be central to team value
- Geographic flexibility would be minimal

### Product Implications

| Need | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Industry profiles | Customized flows by sector |
| Timeline expectations | Industry-specific process length |
| Compensation modeling | Sector-appropriate comp structures |
| Legal guidance | Non-compete/garden leave information |
| Success metrics | Industry-relevant KPIs |
