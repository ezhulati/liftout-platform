## 2. Company Story

### The Founding

NextGen Financial was founded in 2019 by three former Goldman Sachs quants who saw an opportunity to democratize financial analytics. Traditional financial institutions were drowning in data but starving for insights. The founders built a platform that turns raw financial data into actionable intelligence.

### The Journey

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2019 | Founded, raised $5M seed from Accel |
| 2020 | First enterprise client (regional bank), 25 employees |
| 2021 | Series A ($35M), expanded to 150 employees |
| 2022 | Launched insurance vertical, Austin office opened |
| 2023 | Series B ($85M), 600 employees, London office |
| 2024 | 850 employees, targeting IPO in 2026 |
| 2025 | Building analytics division (why they need TechFlow) |

### The Product

NextGen offers a B2B SaaS platform for financial analytics:

- **Core Product**: Real-time financial data integration and visualization
- **AI Layer**: Predictive models for risk, fraud, and market trends
- **Customers**: Banks, insurance companies, wealth managers, hedge funds
- **Revenue Model**: Annual enterprise licenses ($500K - $5M/year)
- **ARR**: ~$85M (2024)

## 3. The Team They're Building

### Why They Need the Analytics Division

CEO's directive (as told to Sarah Rodriguez):
> "We have a great product for our customers' analytics. But our internal analytics are a mess. We're making $85M decisions based on Excel spreadsheets and gut feel. I want a world-class data science team—in-house—that can give us the same capabilities we sell to our customers."

### The Mandate

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Team Size** | 4-6 people |
| **Deadline** | Operational in 90 days |
| **Budget** | $1.5M total comp (first year) |
| **Reporting** | Direct to CTO |
| **Mandate** | Build internal analytics from scratch |
| **Authority** | Full P&L responsibility for analytics function |

### What They'll Build

1. **Executive Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into business performance
2. **Churn Prediction**: Which enterprise customers are at risk
3. **Revenue Forecasting**: ML-based projections (not spreadsheet extrapolation)
4. **Sales Analytics**: Which deals will close, when, for how much
5. **Product Analytics**: Feature usage, adoption, stickiness
6. **Operational Efficiency**: Cost optimization across the business

## 7. Why NextGen Chose Team-Based Hiring

### The Failed Alternatives

Before finding Liftout, NextGen tried:

| Approach | Outcome | Why It Failed |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Agency recruiters | 2 hires in 3 months | Too slow, no team chemistry |
| Internal transfers | 1 analyst moved | Wrong skill set |
| Acquihire (startup) | Fell apart after 4 months | Valuation disagreement |
| Contractors (Toptal) | 3 contractors, temporary | No ownership mentality |

### The Math That Convinced the CFO

Sarah presented this analysis to get budget approval:

**Scenario A: Individual Hiring**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| 4 senior hires at $275K avg | $1.1M salary |
| Recruiter fees (20% each) | $220K |
| 6-month ramp (50% productivity) | $550K opportunity cost |
| 12-month attrition risk (30%) | 1.2 hires replaced |
| **Total Year 1 Cost** | **$1.87M** |
| **Time to Full Productivity** | **12-18 months** |

**Scenario B: Team Hire (Liftout)**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| 4 team members at $297K avg | $1.19M salary |
| Platform fee (8%) | $95K |
| 2-week ramp (90% productivity) | $46K opportunity cost |
| Team retention (96% at 12 months) | Minimal replacement |
| **Total Year 1 Cost** | **$1.33M** |
| **Time to Full Productivity** | **15 days** |

**Savings**: $540K (29% less) + 10 months faster to impact

### Why NextGen Chose TechFlow

| Factor | TechFlow Score | Why It Mattered |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|

| **Cohesion Score** | 94/100 | Chemistry is real |
| **Industry Fit** | FinTech | Relevant domain experience |
| **Location** | Bay Area → NYC (hybrid OK) | Workable with hybrid |
| **Salary Range** | $180K-$280K | Within budget |
| **Availability** | 4 weeks notice | Fast enough |

### The Interview Process
