# Liftout Platform - Project Requirements

## What is a Liftout?

A **liftout** is the practice of hiring an entire high-performing team from another company that already works well together. Unlike individual recruiting or project-based freelancing, liftouts involve acquiring intact teams with established relationships, trust, and proven collaboration patterns.

### Key Characteristics of Liftouts:
- **Team-based hiring**: Acquiring 2+ people who work together as a unit
- **Established relationships**: Teams with existing trust and collaboration patterns
- **Proven performance**: High-functioning groups with track records
- **Immediate productivity**: Teams can "hit the ground running" without team formation phases
- **Preserved dynamics**: Maintaining institutional knowledge and team chemistry
- **Common in professional services**: Law, investment banking, consulting, advertising, medicine

### Historical Context:
- First major corporate liftout: 1946 "Whiz Kids" (10 Air Force officers to Ford Motor Company)
- Strategic alternative to mergers/acquisitions with lower risk
- Enables rapid expansion into new markets or capabilities
- Can inflict competitive damage on rivals while gaining proven talent
